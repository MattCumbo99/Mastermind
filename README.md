MASTERMIND INSTRUCTIONS

The goal of the game is to crack the four-color combination consisting of either black, red, green, blue, white, or yellow. The code is
randomized each time you open the application or when you select 'new game' in the options menu. You have 10 attempts to crack it.

When you select four colors, the little squares on the right of the combination you chose may change colors, depending on how close you
got to the correct combination. They are as follows:
    Black = one color does not belong in the final code
    White = one color belongs in the final code but is not in the right spot
    Red = one color belongs in the final code and is in the right spot

This means that if you guess "Red Red Green Blue" and the final code is "Blue Red Red Red", you would get 1 red, 2 white, and one black.

If you select 'new game' and haven't cracked the code, it shows what it was in a popup window before beginning a new game.
